#summary How to use sybase-proc-maven-plugin in your maven project.

= Maven repository =

The sybase-proc-maven-plugin is hosted on OSS SONATYPE repository, thus, in order to use it in your maven project you must add the OSS SONATYPE repository configuration to your pom.xml file.

Add following code to your pom.xml:

{{{
<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>sonatype-oss-public</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
}}}

= Downloads =

To see all available downloads visit [https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/com/googlecode/msidor/maven/plugins/sybase-proc-maven-plugin/ OSS SONATYPE repository for sybase-proc-maven-plugin].

= JCONNECT Dependency =

The sybase-proc-maven-plugin depends on JCONNECT SYBASE driver. 
However the JCONNECT driver is not included in the project dependencies nor is available from any public maven repository (as for today). 

Thus, the JCONNECT must be explictly configured in sybase-proc-maven-plugin configuration.

== Installing JCONNECT driver ==

If you are interested in this plugin, it is very likely that your project uses already the JCONNECT driver.
