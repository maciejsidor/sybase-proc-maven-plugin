#summary Introduction to functionnality of sybase-proc-maven-plugin.

= Introduction =

Maven plugin that allows to generate sources of SYBASE stored procedures so the generated files might then be versioned together with project code.

This plugin allows to generate sources for selected procedures as well as all sub-procedures that are being called by "exec" command.

Additionally, the stored procedures configuration might be publish automatically to CONFLUENCE.

== Tasks ==

The functionality of sybase-proc-maven-plugin might be summarized in following tasks:

Parsing of stored procedure configuration file (if one has been given)
Establishing SYBASE connection
Retrieving stored procedures and all sub-procedures
Writing summary report HTML table with all procedures that have been identified and dependencies among them (optional)
Extracting SQL scripts for all stored procedures and all sub-procedures found
Deleting files that were not concerned by the generation (optional)

Detecting sub-procedure calls is based on procedure body parsing (lookup for "exec" keyword) where commented calls are ignored.
 
 The SQL scripts are written-out only if the SQL file for procedure doesn't exist yet or if the procedure body has been changed against the existing SQL file
 
Additionally, this goal may generate HTML table row summarizing the procedure and its sub-procedures basic info. 
The table row is composed of 4 rows:
Nested level (0 for top level procedure)
Procedure name
Database name
Compilation date

This report file might be used after to publish the procedure configuration in CONFLENCE by calling the "publish" goal.
